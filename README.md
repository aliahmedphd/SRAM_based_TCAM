This initiative is a collaboration between MERL laboratory at Usman Institute of Technology and VLSIDA laboratory at University of Califronia, Santa Cruz.
This project is tied as an accelerator to the management SoC. It mimic the functionality of TCAM using SRAM. We will utilize OpenRAM to generate SRAM-based TCAM.

This is the high level view of memory architecture
